# To-Do : Using For Loop

We have used for loop to print numbers from 1 to 20. We have used a variable i which is initialized at value 20. Then, the condition is that i > = 1. If the condition is true, the program prints the number and finally, the variable is updated using shortcut i - = 1.

```js
for (i = 20; i >= 1; i -= 1) {
  console.log("number is ", i);
}
```
