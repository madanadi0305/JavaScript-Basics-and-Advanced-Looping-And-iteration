# Looping & Iterations Exercise 06

 Write a JavaScript program to create a function which returns the smallest round number that is not less than a given value. A round number is informally considered to be an integer that ends with one or more zeros. For eg. 52 will be rounded to 60 and 596 is rounded to 600. Your output code should return the output variable.

Hints:

- Declare functions with name and parameter
- Use while loop to calculate the value of round number and return result
- Create output variable and call function with arguments
- Return the output variable
