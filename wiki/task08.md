# Looping & Iterations Exercise 08

Write a js program to create a function which takes 2 integers as inputs. The function divides the first integer with second integer as long as the result (Quotient) is an integer (i.e. remainder is zero) and return the quotient as result. The function divides the first integer with second integer as long as the result (Quotient) is an integer (i.e. remainder is zero) and return the quotient as result. Your output code should return the output variable.
 Sample input (123456,2)  Output 1929, Sample input (54,11)  Output 54 
Hints:

- Declare functions with name and parameter
- Use if to check if divisor is 1. If true,return the number
- Use else and while loop to calculate the integer and return as result
- Create output variable and call function with arguments
- Return the output variable
