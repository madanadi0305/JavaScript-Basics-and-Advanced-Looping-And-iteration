# Looping & Iterations Exercise 17

Write a JS program. This program contains a function which takes one argument: a positive number and returns factorial of that number. For an integer n greater than or equal to 1, the _factorial_ is the product of all integers less than or equal to n but greater than or equal to 1. Sample Input: number = 6 . Expected Output : 720.

Hints:

- Create a function with name and parameters
- Declare local variables and assign values
- Use recursion to compute the factorial
- Return the result and call the function with arguments
- Assign result in output variable and Return the output variable
