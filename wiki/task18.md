# Looping & Iterations Exercise 18

Write a JS program. This program contains a function which takes two arguments which are two positive numbers and returns GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) of these two numbers.

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer number that divides both the numbers without leaving any remainder. GCD is also known as HCF (Highest Common Factor). 

Sample Input: num1 = 30 ,num2 = 45 . Expected Output : 15.

Hints:

- Create a function with name and parameters
- Declare local variables and assign values
- Use recursion to compute GCD of two numbers
- Return the result and call the function with arguments
- Assign result in output variable and Return the output variable
